# Practicing Git commands and GitHub essentials. 
**_This project does nothing. It is purely educational - a pedagogical effort in learning Git and GitHub._**

## What do I plan to learn? 
* Git VCS - ins and outs. 
  * Working with branches
  * Stashing 
  * Merging
  * Time Travelling and Undoing Changes
  * Git Diff
  * Resolving Merge Conflicts
